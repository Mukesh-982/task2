			<h2>2008–2009: Debut and maiden stint</h2>
			<p> On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.[47] However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, with a total of fifty-four runs scored.[48]</p>
			<p> Kohli also made his International T20 debut against Zimbabwe at Harare, where he scored an unbeaten 26.[70] Later that month, during the 2010 Asia Cup, Kohli was included in the Indian team and was given the role of batting at number 3.Kohli made his Test debut at Kingston in the first match of the Test series that followed</p>
			<h2>2010-2011: Rise through the ranks</h2>
			<img src="D:\tributepage\Virat_Kohli_Batting.jpg" alt="virat">
			<p>In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as Tendulkar was rested for the event.[64] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.[65] He was widely hailed for his performances, and ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an impressive average of 91.66. Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain MS Dhoni has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come across different to the world."</p>
			<p>Kohli was India's leading run scorer in the five-match ODI series of the South African tour in January 2011, with 193 runs including two fifties, both in Indian defeats.[79] During the series, he jumped to number two spot on the ICC Rankings for Men's ODI batters, and was named in India's 15-man squad for the World Cup.</p>
			<h2>2012–2013: ODI ascendancy and ascension to vice-captaincy</h2>
			<p>Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performances in Australia. Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored his personal best of 183 from 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. He helped India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run chase at the time. His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history surpassing previous record of 144 by Younis Khan in 2004 and the joint second highest score along with Dhoni in an ODI run-chase; also became the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs. Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both the matches that India won, nonetheless India could not progress to the final of the tournament.</p>
			<h2>2014: T20 World Cup and assuming Test-captaincy</h2>
			<p>"Kohli is the next chosen one. He exudes the intensity of Dravid, the audacity of Sehwag, and the extraordinary range of Tendulkar. That doesn't make him better, simply sui generis, his own unique kind."</p>
			<img src="D:\tributepage\test.jpg" alt="virat" width="2000px">
			<p>Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket at the conclusion of this match and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney.[192] Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hits 147 runs in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain.[193] He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and the match ended in a draw.[194] Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests is the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.</p>
			<h2>2015–2016: World Cups and limited-over success</h2>
			<p>Kohli was able to rise to the occasion and deliver a commanding performance in the first match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide by scoring 107 runs from 126 deliveries.</p>
			<img src="D:\tributepage\vk1.jpg" alt="virat" >
			<p>Playing his first Test in the West Indies since his debut series, Kohli scored 200 in the first Test at Antigua to ensure an innings-and-92-run win for India, their biggest win ever outside of Asia. It was his first double hundred in first-class cricket and the first made away from home by an Indian captain in Tests.[216] India went on to wrap the series 2–0 and briefly top the ICC Test Rankings before being displaced by Pakistan at the position. He scored another double hundred, 211 at Indore in the third Test against New Zealand as India's 3–0 whitewash victory saw them regain the top position in the ICC Test Rankings.</p>
			<h2>2017–2018: Dominant batting and leadership</h2>
			<p>Kohli got double centuries in the next two Test series against England and Bangladesh, making him the first batsman ever to score double centuries in four consecutive series. He broke the record of Australian great Donald Bradman and Rahul Dravid, both of whom had managed to get three. Against England, he scored his then-highest Test score of 235.</p>

			<p>On 16 December 2018 in the 2018–2019 Border Gavaskar Trophy, Kohli scored his 25th test hundred in Perth. His knock of 123 was his 6th hundred in three tours to Australia making him the only Indian to score 6 test hundreds in Australia after Sachin Tendulkar.[244] He also became the fastest Indian and second fastest overall (125 innings) to score 25 test hundreds,[245] second only to Donald Bradman (68 innings); which was bettered by Steven Smith during 2019 Ashes (119 innings).[246] Kohli's knock was rated by several analysts and former cricketers as one of his finest against a quality Australian attack.[247] Although he broke several records in the game his innings proved to be insufficient as India went down by 146 runs as Australia leveled the series with two tests remaining.[248][249] Overall, he finished the series with 282 runs at an average of 40.[250] By winning the test series in Australia he had become the first Indian and also the first Asian skipper to win a test series in Australia.[251] He was again named as captain of both the World Test XI and ODI XI for 2018 by the ICC.</p>
			<h2>2019–2020: Record breaking captaincy and batting woes</h2>
			<p>In April 2019, he was named the captain of India's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.[253] On 16 June 2019, in India's match against Pakistan, Kohli became the fastest batsman in terms of innings to score 11,000 runs in ODI cricket. </p>
			<h3>Slump in form</h3>
			<p>India toured to New Zealand from January to March 2020 to play 5-match T20I series along with a 3 and 2-match ODI and test series respectively. During the tour, Kolhi only managed to score 218 runs across formats in 12 innings at an average of 19.81 with only one fifty plus score during first ODI. This was his lowest aggregate of runs in a tour where he played in all formats.</p>
			<h2>2021–2022: Captaincy exit and resurgence</h2>
			<p>The 2021 ICC World Test Championship Final was played in June 2021, which India lost to New Zealand.[275] This was Kohli's third defeat as captain in a knockout game of an ICC tournament.[276] He scored 44 and 13 in two innings before getting dismissed by Kyle Jamieson on both occasions .</p>
			<h3>Retirement from captaincy across formats</h3>
			<img src="D:\tributepage\vk.jpg" alt="virat">
			<p>In December 2021, Kohli was replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's ODI captain. The BCCI President, Sourav Ganguly, disclosed that Kohli's removal from the ODI captaincy was attributed to the selectors decision to avoid having two leaders for the white ball format. However, he also conveyed that Kohli was asked to remain the captain of the T20I.[280] During a press conference, Kohli disputed the BCCI President's statement, affirming that his decision to step down from the captaincy was well-received and viewed as a positive move by the BCCI officials. Kohli also claimed that he was informed about his dismissal from the ODI captaincy by the chief selector, Chetan Sharma, 90 minutes before the announcement of the Test squad for India's tour of South Africa.[281] More than a week later, during the announcement of the squad for the ODI series against South Africa, Sharma refuted Kohli's claim and stated that the officials had urged him to reconsider his decision to relinquish his role as T20I captain.</p>
			<h2>Return to form</h2>
			<img  src="D:\tributepage\t20.jpg" alt="virat" width="2000px" height="1200px" >
			<p>Kohli made a resurgence of his form during the Asia Cup 2022, Over the course of the tournament, he amassed a total of 276 runs with a average of 92, The highlight of his performance was his maiden T20I century against Afghanistan, a knock that saw him score 122 runs from 61 deliveries, it was his first century in 1020 days.[296] He later said in post match presentation that:

				"Last two and a half years have taught me a lot. I am going to turn 34 in a month. So those angry celebrations are a thing of the past . I have had many suggestions, lot of advice has come my way; people were telling me I was doing this wrong, that wrong, I picked out all the videos from the best time I had; same initial movement, same approach towards the ball and it was just what was happening inside my head I wasn't able to explain it to anyone "</p>
